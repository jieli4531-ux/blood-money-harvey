            <h2>Blood Money: Harvey</h2>
            <p>
              The room smelled faintly of dust and lavender. A single lamp flickered, casting soft shadows over the pink-haired man in the chair. His name was Harvey Harvington, and he smiled as though nothing in the world could trouble him. His crisp suit, his calm tone, the way he tilted his head when he spoke—it all made him feel more like a charming host than a victim.</p>
              <br>
<p>“You need money, don’t you?” he said, his voice almost musical. “Twenty-five thousand dollars, if I’m not mistaken. A surgery. A chance to live.”</p>
<br>
<p>His eyes gleamed with something between pity and amusement. “I can help. Every time you touch me, you’ll earn one dollar. Simple enough, isn’t it? Just… one dollar at a time.”</p>
<br>
<p>At first, it seemed harmless. A brush of the finger, a soft tap, a feather grazing his arm. Harvey laughed warmly, even encouraging. “See? That wasn’t so bad.” The money trickled in slowly, but it was real.</p>
<br>
<p>But desperation has a way of twisting patience. Soon, the feather felt too slow. A needle bought more speed. Harvey winced, but smiled anyway. “Don’t worry. I understand.” His voice cracked, but his courtesy never wavered.</p>
<br>
<p>Scissors replaced needles. Fire replaced feathers. With each upgrade, Harvey’s smile grew thinner, strained at the edges. Blood soaked through his once-perfect suit. His voice, once gentle, began to tremble. He encouraged you still, though it sounded less like kindness and more like obligation.</p>
<br>

<p>By the time the knife came out, the room no longer smelled of lavender. It reeked of iron, of something burned and broken. Harvey’s words faltered into whispers. “You’re… almost there… just a little more…” His pink curls clung to his face with sweat and blood.</p>
<br>

<p>And then came the gun.</p>
<br>

<p>It was the final step—the fastest way to the goal. But Harvey no longer smiled. His eyes, wide and glistening, met yours not with kindness, but with a question: What have you become?</p>
<br>

<p>The money counter reached its mark. Twenty-five thousand. Enough to live. But as Harvey’s body slumped forward, as silence swallowed the room, the weight of every dollar pressed down on your chest like a curse.</p>
<br>

<p>In the end, you had survived. But Harvey had changed you forever.</p>
<br>

          <h2>Core Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>Earn money by clicking: Each click on Harvey causes slight harm but gives you $1.</li>
              <li>Upgrade “tools” to increase income: Money earned can be spent on different tools. These range from harmless (like a feather) to lethal (like a gun). Each upgrade increases your earnings but also intensifies Harvey’s pain.</li>
              
            </ul>
            <div class="specs">
              <h2>Examples of tools</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Feather (~$100) – Small income boost; very light, almost painless.</li>
                <li>Needle (~$500) – Moderate income boost; causes mild pain.</li>
                <li>Scissors (~$3,000) – Significant income boost; inflicts severe wounds and visible pain.</li>
                <li>Match/Fire (~$6,000) – Large income boost; extreme pain, almost unbearable.</li>
                <li>Knife (~$10,000) – High income boost; near-lethal, excruciating pain.</li>
                <li>Gun (~$20,000) – Maximum income boost; catastrophic damage, brutally cruel.</li>
              </ul>
